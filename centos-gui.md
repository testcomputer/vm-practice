2. Installing the KDE Desktop:

KDE is another popular desktop environment known for its customizability.

    Update your system:

    bash

sudo yum update -y

Install the KDE Desktop package group:

bash

sudo yum groupinstall "KDE Plasma Workspaces" -y

Set the system to boot directly into the GUI:

bash

sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target

Reboot the system:

bash

    sudo reboot

Upon reboot, the system should load the KDE desktop environment.
Notes:

    After installing the desired GUI, you can switch between the graphical and multi-user (command line) targets using the following commands:
        For GUI: sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
        For Command Line: sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target

    Ensure you have sufficient system resources, especially if running CentOS on a virtual machine. GUIs require more system resources than a headless (no GUI) setup.

    If you're accessing your CentOS machine remotely, consider using tools like VNC for GUI access after the installation.
